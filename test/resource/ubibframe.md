BIBFRAME Micro is an even smaller extraction from BIBFRAME Lite. BIBFRAME Lite is a starting point for customized
BIBFRAME vocabularies and profiles. It is the same framework and link-compatible with the US Library of Congress's
BIBFRAME vocabulary, http://bibframe.org/

BIBFRAME Lite is expressed using the Versa data model, which also allows for full expression in RDF form.
This particular file is in the Versa Literate syntax, based on the Markdown format
<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics>.

The convention for expressing data models in Versa Literate has each vocabulary item starting with a new header,
A level 1 header for resource classes and level 2 for properties.  Each has its ID as an IRI reference
(usually relative). Each is then described within its section's unordered list, given a "label" (display label),
"description" (also for explanatory display), possibly "synonyms" (one or more loose expression that the resource
can be considered a synonym for another). Resource classes may also have "properties" (space-separated list of
property IDs defined on the resource). Properties may also have "value" (textual description of the expected
value of the property, perhaps as a relationship to another resource, or as a data value).

You'll notice that BIBFRAME terms use a humpCase/HumpCase convention, which derives from BIBFRAME legacy.

# @docheader

<!---
@base is the default base IRI, used e.g. for resource headers. It would also be used for properties except that it is
overridden by @property-base

The meta-properties in this file are actually defined by the Versa data model to support interpretation by Versa modeling tools

@resource-base is another possible override, for resource headers, but not used here
