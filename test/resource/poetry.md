* summary: It's as if that vengeful god has called;
He's up the sky soon to be burst with terrors
That serve us right for existential crime;
Not satisfied with nasty, brutish, short,
He's fashioned out a fathomless device
And rigged it to the doomsday clock's last chime.
They sing: 'God gave Noah the rainbow sign,
Warning: No more water, but fire next time!'

* summary: So what are you saying?
We are all cowards in this village?
    A chalk-man of cassava flesh
    ignoring the mighty leopard men of Amaraku
    laying an iron path through our own yam plots
    terrifying us with his blockhead beasts?
